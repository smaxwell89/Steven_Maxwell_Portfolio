# Sunspots Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project investigates over **230 years of monthly sunspot activity** (1749â€“1983) and applies **time series analysis** to forecast the next 11-year solar cycle.  
Sunspots follow an approximately **11-year cycle**, and accurate forecasting is important for understanding long-term solar activity and its potential impact on **space weather, satellite operations, and climate research**.  

The goal of this project is to:
- Explore historical sunspot data for seasonality and long-term trends.  
- Apply **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** modeling to capture cyclical patterns.  
- Generate forecasts of sunspot activity for the next 11-year cycle.  
- Evaluate model performance and residual diagnostics.
